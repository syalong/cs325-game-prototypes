<h2>Cheat Boss</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Cheat your way through the cooking competition
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who will do whatever it takes
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: deterministic</li>
<li>Genre: Simulation</li>
<li>Play Style: Competitor, Craftsman?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to enjoy the fact that they will never have to go through the character's struggle
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use the arrow keys to move their spoon around.  The spacebar is meant to be used to pick up ingredients and drop them into the bowl.  The R key is meant to bring up a recipe to cheat.
<ul>
Missing from Prototype:
<li>The use of the spacebar</li>
<li>Recipe effectively disappearing after pressing R again</li>
<li>There is no outside pressure (judges/commentators) to try to make you stop cheating</li>
<li>Ingredients not meant to go into the mix</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Trying to explore adding and removing something with a button.  Trying to pick things up when cursor is above selected item.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
As it is, players hopefully won't need to cheat.  If polished, needing to balance cheating and just going for it.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a Cake Boss Battle
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a Cake Boss wannabe, but you don't do very well under pressure.  You know for a fact that everyone else who has competed in this competition plays fair and knows their recipes by heart.  You can't help yourself.  You really want to win.  So what do you do?  You weasel in a recipe and try to cheat your way to the top.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes to feel like they've accomplished something
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As is, the player is stuck here forever.  If polished, a few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't cheat too much
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Didn't look at Phaser examples.  Used my own game, Cow Catch, as a point of reference.
