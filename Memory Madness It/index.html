<h2>Memory Madness Iteration</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Sort the good memories and the bad memories accordingly!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Television is broadcasting actual memories
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: mouse/keyboard</li>
<li>Randomness: Random</li>
<li>Genre: Casual</li>
<li>Play Style: Craftsman?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel like they are taking part in embarassment control in the brain.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player presses the spacebar to bring up a new memory.  If the memory is good(green), drag the memory to the good memory box.  If the memory is bad(red), drag the memory to the bad memory box.
<ul>Missing/bugs:
<li>Punishment for missorting</li>
<li>Spacebar does not bring up only one memory</li>
<li>Only the first bad memory in a set of memories that is put into the box will be sorted.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix the bug that only seems to bring up bad memories all the time</li>
<li>Implement dragging and dropping instead of using the arrow keys</li>
<li>add in memory boxes</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Player gets to explore to some extent what it's like being a worker in the brain
</li>
